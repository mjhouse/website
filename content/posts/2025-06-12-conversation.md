I eased out into the light and stood for a long moment, giving the big man time to look me over. He froze for a beat, then continued as if I hadn't just appeared out of a dark forest a hundred miles from the nearest street light. He was... hard to describe. A mess of contradictions. His hair was wild and long, matted together and tangled. It wasn't clear where his beard began or ended. His eyes were clear and young though, peering out of the shadows beneath the tangle. He was big- much bigger than I was, and I wasn't a small man, even at twenty-three. Perhaps as much as three hundred pounds, and maybe six foot five or six six.
