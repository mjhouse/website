The man by the fire was much bigger that I was, and I wasn't a particularly small man. He must have been three hundred pounds and maybe six foot five or six six. His hair was wild and long, matted together and tangled so that it wasn't clear where his beard began or ended. His clothes where a wild patchwork of leather and furs. In contrast to his dark and tangled appearance, his eyes were clear and shockingly blue, as if they belonged to a much younger man. They turned to me as soon as a I appeared.

For a moment, I stood awkwardly at the edge of the fire light, trying to decide whether I should retreat or continue. Just as I decided that discretion was the better part of whatever valor I possessed, the man jerked his head toward a log and grunted in a way that seemed somewhat welcoming. I sat. We stared at each other across the fire, and I studied him more closely. My first impression- that the man looked like a large, but exceptionally intelligent bear that had taught itself to walk on it's hind legs, was born out by closer study. 

He was wrapped neck-to-ankles in a patchwork of furs, old and worn clothes, bare leather, and rags. His hair flowed down, merged with his beard, and continued on to meet the fur wrapped across his shoulders. With his size, the bulging muscles visible on his forearm as he threw another log on the fire, and the intimidating silence, he gave the impression that he was a naturally occuring part of the world. Like a hurricane sweeping across bare highlands, or a weathered mountain fading into the background of some remote village. The little that I could see of his face was as craggy as some of the peaks that I had seen on the long journey into the eastern wastes. The only thing about him that seemed alive were his eyes.

We regarded each other warily across the fire. I cleared my throat.

"I appreciate the invitation to your fire." I said tentatively. He continued to stare at me.

"Is there a village nearby?"

"No."
