Everyone has moral intuitions. They (probably) come from some combination of our biology, environment, culture, and personal reasoning. Moral philosophy[^1] is the practice of comparing those intuitions to each other to tease out contradictions and inconsistencies. Once you've done this, you can discard or adjust some of your positions to reduce the inconsistency. The goal is to create a moral framework that is as simple as it can be, but no simpler[^2].

I'm not a moral philosopher in any sort of formal sense, but I think that the practice I've just described should be done by everyone. We all have a patchwork of moral beliefs, some inherited from parents, some picked up from friends or the media. Teasing out the inconsistencies helps us clarify what is most important to us[^3], and allows us to discard beliefs that contradict other, more deeply held convictions. Having a flexible, battle tested, and simple moral framework allows us to make good decisions.

I have observed that when I think about bad things happening to people a long way away, I generally don't feel much. I know that children being murdered in a different country is just as *bad* as children being murdered in my neighborhood, because I can't see any way that distance would change the degree of badness. It just doesn't hit me emotionally as much as it should. It's not that I *couldn't* get emotional about it- I could. I could watch videos about it, think about it a lot, and I'm sure that eventually I'd have an emotional reaction to it. It's just a lot more work than if the murders were happening nearby. I think emotions are unreliable indicators of whether something is morally wrong or not.

My *moral intuition*, on the other hand, comes to the same conclusion whether the children are close or distant. It's very wrong. There are unlikely edge cases where killing one child saves some number of others, but the base case is that it's very wrong.




[^1]: This is a personal definition. I'm not formally educated in any of this, and I'm taking what seems useful and discarding everything that seems pedantic or pointless.

[^2]: Although the internet has taught me to be suspicious of quotes from Einstein, the saying "everything should be as simple as it can be, but no simpler" was probably a somewhat wittier phrasing of something he actually did say.
