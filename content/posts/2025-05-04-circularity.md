I raised my hand to knock on the front door of the little house, but hesitated, eyeing the sign on the front lawn again. Was it, really, *really* worth it to knock on this particular door? It was almost lunch, and I'd visited dozens- I glanced down at my clipboard- *thirty-four* houses this morning. I was tired from walking, but more tired of talking. And the odds that anyone in this particular house would be interested in what I had to say was low. 

*Very* low.

The house *was* on my list, though. And I could break for lunch after. And if it was bad enough, maybe I could win the casual competition that all of the reps had going to see who got the worst houses. *And* I'd buy myself a bag of peanut butter M&Ms from the vending machine in the office.

With multiple layers of internal bribery doing their work on my nerves, I steeled myself and tried to knock confidently.

After a few minutes, I heard a heavy tread from inside the home. I stepped back and (with only a little difficulty) plastered a pleasant smile on my face. I couldn't stop my eyes from cutting sideways to the red sign in the front yard before the door opened, but they snapped back immediately. The door opened half way, and a man about my size peered out at me. He was greying, a bit, overweight, also a bit, and wearing a button down shirt with a pen in the front pocket.

"Yeah?" He asked, a bit suspiciously.

"Hi! How are you today?" I tried to put a bit of a laugh into my voice and couldn't. I settled for cranking up the intensity of my smile half a notch.

"Fine."

"I'm with the Aspen Initiative. We're gathering signatures to show our elected representatives that our community values the parks and forest around the city."

"Is this about H243?" He asked, raising one eyebrow.

"Yes! H243 would allow the city to sell off public land to private enterprises, who could then-" I began. I was interrupted by a snort from the man, who opened the door and leaned against the frame, crossing his arms over his chest.

"They're not gonna' do that." He said, with a smirk.

"Why would they put forward an ordinance if they weren't going to use it?" I asked, but my heart was already sinking.

"It's politics! Scanlan puts this thing out, he goes on the news and talks about it, and all the companies come begging to cut a deal with the city for access to those parks. I wouldn't be surprised if he's using it to put pressure on the other members too. They know he's got the votes and the balls to do it, and he can leverage that. He's a good businessman! With emphasis on the *business*- this is what he *does*."

"Wouldn't a businessman in his position simply pass the ordinance and then sell the parks?" I asked. I could see the gleam in his eyes as he leaned into the conversation, his smile wide and faintly condescending.

"He *gave up* managing his businesses to take a position in the city council. He was making more money in a day than I see in a month! And he gave all that up to try to make this city a better place to live. The man is an altruist!"

"He hasn't actually *sold* his businesses. He still owns a significant stake in two logging compan-" I began.

"And if he does sell them, those parks could bring a huge amount of investment into the community! Companies mean equipment, buildings, and *jobs*. Think about what this city could be in five or ten years with that sort of investment." He continued, speaking over me casually. And, I noticed, seamlessly changing the direction of his argument without batting an eye.

"But if he sells the parks to companies that he *owns*, isn't that-"

"They're not gonna' do that." He said again.

"Why not?"

"He's a politician! He knows which side his bread is buttered on. You pull something like that, and you'll lose votes in the next election. That's all any of them care about. They're all crooked." He shook his head in disbelief at the state of the world.

"This is Scanlan's last term, though. He can't run again." 

"Exactly! He's not like the rest of them! He can actually *get things done*, while the rest are scrabbling around after votes." The man said confidently.

"But you said he's not-" I began again. I already had a feel for how this was going to go, and I was entirely unsurprised when he interrupted me.

"Besides, those parks are full of freaks and weirdos. I wouldn't be surprised if they're selling drugs out there, or kidnapping people off the walking paths and dragging them back in the woods to rape them. There's some pretty nasty people out there."

"I've heard there's some sort of Wiccan group that uses the parks, but I don't think they're-"

"Exactly! Buncha' fucking freaks. Goddamn perverts harrassing regular people who are just out with their families!" He said, glowering.

"So, just to recap- Scanlan is a businessman, which is why he *won't* sell the parks to private corporations, and is using them as leverage to cut some *other*, unspecified, deal with either the companies themselves or his fellow councilmembers. He's an altruist who gave up his life of wealth and ease to help us build a better city, despite still owning a stake in several logging companies, a fact which has *nothing whatsoever* to do with the bill that he *definitely* won't actually follow through with, to get votes, which he doesn't need because it's his last term. And-"

I checked off the house on my clipboard.

"-unrelated, but some of the people who use the park are 'freaks, weirdos, and goddamn perverts', to use your words. Does that about sum it up?"

"FUCK YOU!"
