I have a habit of trying to come up with solutions to infrastructure problems. 

One of my favorite ideas is to use underground parking to gradually change the design of car-centric cities in the southeast and make public transit more viable. Cities in the southeastern part of the United States rely on personal vehicles a lot more than large cities elsewhere in the country, even for a country as car-centric as the United States is. I think it's probably because we have a lot of space and a lot of rural areas that use personal vehicles anyway (a subway isn't going to drop you off at a farm), and people bring those vehicles when they move to the city. Regardless of the reason, it's a fact that our cities tend to sprawl.

Public transport like you might see in New York just doesn't work in the south. Busses do, but even those are less effective, and any sort of subway or metro is almost entirely useless. Imagine building a metro in a city designed entirely around personal vehicles. *Everything* is more spread out. There's no easy way to walk a few blocks when there is a highway between you and the next block. All of the stores are pushed apart by large roads and parking lots, and the roads rarely have sidewalks or bike lanes. Anyone who wants to use the subway would (likely) have to walk for quite a distance to reach it, and that's only if they're lucky and live in the general area. If they're not, they would have to drive to the subway. Then there's another walk on the other end, and again, because the city is designed around roads and highways, that walk is likely one that will take you down the sides of roads with no sidewalk, or across several lanes of traffic. 

It's a chicken and egg problem. If we could reduce the number of roads and parking lots, we could redesign the city so that people *could* easily walk to their destination, and then a subway would work fine. If we had a subway, we wouldn't need so many large roads and parking lots, which would make the city more dense and walkable. I could go into the merits of why a denser, more walkable city is better than a sprawling city threaded with highways, but I want to get into some details and I've got other things to do today, so I'm going to skip over that conversation and move on to the scheme-y parts.

What we need is a way to bridge the gap between a vehicle-centric city, and one with more public transport. If we can find a way to get some of the benefits of fewer cars, without actually *having* fewer cars, then we can make a city viable for a metro. *Then*, once the metro is built, it will continue to drive changes in the city that actually lead to fewer cars on the road. 

The solution, I think, is underground parking. This technology [currently exists](https://roboticparking.com/)
