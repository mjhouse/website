<small>Trump holding up a list of reciprocal tariffs. Whether they're actually reciprocal or a
[misunderstanding about trade deficits](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/04/trumps-misleading-tariff-chart/) 
is left as an exercise to the reader.</small>

I've been thinking a lot about the tariffs that the Trump administration has recently put in place
on imports into the US. I don't think that they'll work, and I think most reasonable people would
probably come to the same conclusion. I know people who disagree with me though, and I thought it
was important that I try to outline and clarify *why* I don't think the tariffs would work.

Companies will raise the price of their products to offset the loss from the tariffs. Because the 
tariffs are [so large](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o) (25-55%), they will likely *have* 
to raise their prices or go out of business, because the tariffs are larger than their profit margin. 
Most people understand that this will happen, but they believe that this is a short-term pain for a longer 
term gain. If the tariffs cost companies enough, they will bring their manufacturing facilities back to 
the US, providing jobs and contributing to the local economy. 

I don't believe that's the case and think that these people are vastly underestimating how 
much pain the tariffs will cause.

These tariffs apply to almost every country that we do business with and almost every industry that we trade in. 
This means that not only are *cars* subject to these tariffs, but the metal, plastic, and electronics that 
go into *making* cars are as well. These are called "[intermediate goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_good)", 
and almost every product that we buy is manufactured from them (if there are companies that own their manufacturing process all 
the way from mining the raw materials to selling the products, I've never heard of them).

So the tariffs are applied to cars, the components of the cars, *and* the raw materials that all of those
intermediate goods are made out of. That means that even if a car manufacturer moves facilities to the US, 
they'll still be paying higher prices for the upstream materials. So we just reshore the component 
manufacturing too, right? That will fix it, and bring even *more* jobs to the US. Except the component
manufacturers will still be paying higher prices for the materials that *they* need to make the components,
and so on. At some point, we reach economic bedrock and it becomes impossible to continue this series of moves. 

Take semiconductors, a vital part of most modern electronic devices (including cars), as an example. 92%
of the manufacturing capability for these chips [is located in Taiwan](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/us_exposure_to_the_taiwanese_semiconductor_industry_11-21-2023_508.pdf), which was just hit with a 32% tariff 
on imports into the United States. These chips are made from proprietary designs using proprietary techniques, 
are sold globally, and were never based in the US to begin with. They will not move their production to 
the US and reproducing that manufacturing capability in the US would take decades to do; decades in which 
the United States would find it impossible to make even simple electronic devices without great expense.

In addition, many of the goods affected by the tariffs are [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)), which means that as the price increases, 
customers will turn to alternatives or refuse to buy the product altogether. Due to decreased demand, 
companies will downsize their manufacturing capability or lay off workers- there's no point in paying 
people to make goods that no one is buying. This means that tariffs could *add* some jobs by forcing businesses 
to reshore their production to the states, then *cost* us jobs by forcing businesses to raise prices and 
reduce production to meet the lower demand for more expensive products.

So the tariffs will likely cause companies to raise prices on their products permanently or semi-permanently,
because their intermediate goods will become more expensive, which will lead (in many cases) to decreased
demand and a reduction in manufacturing jobs in the US. But will they still build more factories and plants
in the states?

Probably not.

Companies will be weighing the expense of building and maintaining factories in the United States (which
may become entirely pointless when the tariffs are removed or reduced) against lost profits from higher
prices and reduced demand. It seems clear that the optimal path, from their point of view, is to lobby 
for tariff exceptions and wait until the tariffs go away.

And they will. This or another administration will do away with them, because the alternative is a United 
States that is unable to compete technologically with the rest of the world. When Germany is manufacturing 
products with parts and electronics sourced from the best global sources at the lowest possible prices, and 
the United States is building lower-quality products (we have to import the expertise that the original manufacturers
already have) at higher expense because we're hobbled by artifical price controls, then Germany will sell to the world and we won't.

So, prices will increase drastically, even for products that are primarily manufactured in the United States 
already (due to the higher cost for intermediate goods), which will lower demand, leading to fewer jobs. 
The companies most affected by the tariffs just have to wait out the tariffs, which they *can*, because permanent 
tariffs would lead to a crippled US economy relative to the rest of the world, and a future administration
would likely understand this. In the meantime, they can lobby for exceptions and make token moves to placate
the US government.

This is why I don't believe that the tariffs will work.
