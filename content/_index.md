I'm a programmer and sometimes essayist who reads far too much cheap fantasy and
sci-fi to be entirely healthy. I was raised in transit and homeschooled until
joining the US Army, where I spent my time trying to find IEDs in a large desert
before returning to school to get a bachelors in Computer Science. At this point
I've worked on almost any type of software you can imagine, from web apps to
embedded cybersecurity tools. I also program for fun and spend a lot of time 
thinking about how we can improve the world through code and technology. And I mean
*really* improve it, not just make another social impact app. 

If you want to hear way too much about transit design, feel free to ask me how 
southern cities in the US could transition to widespread public transit despite 
their sprawling, car-centric design.
